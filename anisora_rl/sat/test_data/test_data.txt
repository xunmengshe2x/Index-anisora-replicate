In this video, we see a scene from the animated film "Frozen" featuring two main characters, Anna and Elsa, in a bedroom setting. Anna, with her brown hair, is on the left side of the bed, and Elsa, with her white hair, is on the right. They are both seated and appear to be engaged in a conversation. Anna is holding a small object, possibly a piece of food, and is looking at Elsa with a concerned expression. Elsa, on the other hand, is looking back at Anna with a gentle smile. The room is decorated with a pink canopy and a purple blanket, and there's a window with curtains in the background. The overall atmosphere of the scene suggests a moment of connection or concern between the two characters.@@test_data/data/cartoon_films_chi_he_dong_xi_38.png
